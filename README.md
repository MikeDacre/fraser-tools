Mike's Random Scripts
=====================

A selection of little unrelated tools that I have written for working with the fraser server.  Use as you wish.

mike.py
-------
A bucket of functions that I use in my other scripts, not important enough to get their own files.
Fraser Tools
============

Little scripts for use on fraser-server.stanford.edu

backup.py
---------

Create and manage directory link trees in order to facilitate backups.
Currently designed to work with rsync jobs, and with CrashPlanPro.
